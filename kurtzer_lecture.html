<strong>An introduction to containers, Singularity and use cases</strong>
<p align="justify">
Containers have changed the way we package up our applications, environments, enable reproducibility and move workloads around. In this talk, we will start at the very beginning by answering the question "What is a container?", then move on to gain a better understanding of how containers relate to the underlying operating system, how to use them, and then talk about Singularity, the coolest container system ever.
